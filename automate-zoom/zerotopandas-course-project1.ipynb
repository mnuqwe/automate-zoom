    "\n",
    "Important links:\n",
    "- Make submissions here: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/course-project\n",
    "- Ask questions here: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/course-project-on-exploratory-data-analysis-discuss-and-share-your-work/11684\n",
    "- Find interesting datasets here: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/recommended-datasets-for-course-project/11711\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the starter notebook for the course project for [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). You will pick a real-world dataset of your choice and apply the concepts learned in this course to perform exploratory data analysis. Use this starter notebook as an outline for your project . Focus on documentation and presentation - this Jupyter notebook will also serve as a project report, so make sure to include detailed explanations wherever possible using Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset must contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows of data\n",
    "* You must ask and answer at least 4 questions about the dataset\n",
    "* Your submission must include at least 4 visualizations (graphs)\n",
    "* Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, apart from the code.\n",
    "* Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted for somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Select a real-world dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "- Find an interesting dataset on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv\n",
    "- The data should be in CSV format, and should contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows\n",
    "- Download the dataset using the [`opendatasets` Python library](https://github.com/JovianML/opendatasets#opendatasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some sample code for downloading the [US Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import opendatasets as od\n",
    "dataset_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset'\n",
    "od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a list of recommended datasets here: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/recommended-datasets-for-course-project/11711\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas\n",
    "- Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.\n",
    "- Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data\n",
    "- Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns\n",
    "- Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.\n",
    "- Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.\n",
    "- Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset\n",
    "- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn\n",
    "- Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary\n",
    "- Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib etc. explain briefly what it does\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis\n",
    "- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections\n",
    "- Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets\n",
    "- Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Make a submission & share your work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload your notebook to your Jovian.ml profile using `jovian.commit`.\n",
    "- **Make a submission here**: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/course-project\n",
    "- Share your work on the forum: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/course-project-on-exploratory-data-analysis-discuss-and-share-your-work/11684\n",
    "- Browse through projects shared by other participants and give feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Step 7: Write a blog post\n",
    "\n",
    "- A blog post is a great way to present and showcase your work.  \n",
    "- Sign up on [Medium.com](https://medium.com) to write a blog post for your project.\n",
    "- Copy over the explanations from your Jupyter notebook into your blog post, and [embed code cells & outputs](https://medium.com/jovianml/share-and-embed-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-jovian-ml-df709a03064e)\n",
    "- Check out the Jovian.ml Medium publication for inspiration: https://medium.com/jovianml\n",

    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \n",
    "conda activate zerotopandas\n",
    "pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook file (it has a `.ipynb` extension) to open it.\n"
